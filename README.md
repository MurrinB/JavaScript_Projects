# JavaScript_Projects
Here are some of the projects I made using JavaScript.

##<a href="https://github.com/MurrinB/JavaScript_Projects/tree/main/Basic_Javascript_Projects/JavaScript_Projects/Pizza_Project">Pizza Menu</a>

In this project I made a menu used to order pizza with a selection of toppings and sizes. It takes the input information and calculates a price for the order.

##<a href="https://github.com/MurrinB/JavaScript_Projects/tree/main/Basic_Javascript_Projects/JavaScript_Projects/TicTacToe">Tic-Tac-Toe</a>

In this project I made the classic game of tic-tac-toe. In this game the user is 'X' and plays the computer. The winner is celebrated with a loud dinging win sound! 
The game will then restart.

I created a 4 function calculator where the user can: add, subtract, divide, and multiply.
